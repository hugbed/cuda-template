# Cuda Library with C++ Executable CMake Project

Basic C++ (built with g++) cmake project with a Cuda library (built with nvcc)

We want to have a cuda independant C++ executable linked with a cuda library.  
This means that the C++ executable is built with a C++ compiler (i.e: gcc) and the cuda code is built with nvcc.
